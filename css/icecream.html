        <i>Requests for strawberry have come in the past couple weeks and I’m glad they did because I almost missed
            strawberry season here in California. My local farm had their last pick this week and I made it just in
            time.

            Before sharing this recipe, I wanted to first test it at home to make sure I had scaled it down properly for
            a 1 quart yield. I also wanted to make sure this is the strawberry recipe I should share. It’s my original
            strawberry ice cream recipe I made in 2011 that we used for MilkMade’s Strawberry Shortcake flavor. It’s a
            Philly style ‘scream, meaning it doesn’t have eggs. I use cream cheese to act as a stabilizer and to help
            thicken the base. Most strawberry ice creams I’ve tasted are pretty icy. This one is not. BUT, the cream
            cheese does offer a slight tang. I think it brings out the brightness of the strawberries, but I had to be
            sure. I tested a few different iterations of eggless vs cream cheese vs custard bases, as well as bases with
            the strawberries cooked vs uncooked. My original recipe still came out the winner so here it is below. </i>
